== README

Our Rails style guide:

1. Don't generate asset files (.coffee and .scss) unless really needed.
2. Don't generate helpers unless really needed.
3. Considering moving helpers into presenters if you have many related to the same function and template.
4. Add new gems in alphabetical order, and below the marked location in the Gemfile to avoid new gems from mixing with Rails' default gems.
5. Only generate the required resources when using resource routes. Use `except:` and `only`.
